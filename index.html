		<p>I wished the beast would exhaust itself, and not be insensible to fatigue, like a steam-engine! But it was of no use. Hours passed, without its showing any signs of exhaustion. Because, professor, that beast is made of sheet-iron. However, Captain Nemo, I replied, without noticing the ironical turn of his phrase, the Nautilus ran aground in open sea. Now the tides are not strong in the Pacific; and if you cannot lighten the Nautilus, I do not see how it will be reinflated. I am at your service, captain.</p>

		<p>Stay here, my friends, said I, detaining them. Let us remain together until we are out of this block. Very well! Master Land's imprudences are beginning. You know him, captain? I then heard the panels shut. The undulations of the sea, which caused a slight rolling motion, ceased. Had the Nautilus quitted the surface of the ocean? Had it gone back to the motionless bed of water? I tried to resist sleep. It was impossible. My breathing grew weak. I felt a mortal cold freeze my stiffened and half-paralyzed limbs. My eyelids, like leaden caps, fell over my eyes. I could not raise them; a morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, bereft me of my being. Then the visions disappeared, and left me in complete insensibility.</p>

		<p>What does one risk in such a calling? said Ned Land. The swallowing of some mouthfuls of sea-water? Ned Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind. Perhaps. Captain Nemo stopped. I admit I could not yet see why this history should interest me.</p>
